# Final Project: Scenario and Review Criteria

## **Estimated time needed:** 2+ hours

## Project Overview

In this final project, you will build and deploy a simple guestbook application. You will roll out updates using Openshift image streams. You will be rolling out a multi-tier version of the guestbook application. Finally, you will create and bind a tone analyzer service instance to your application and autoscale the guestbook.

## Review Criteria

After completing the hands-on lab: Build and Deploy a Simple Guestbook App, you will complete the peer-graded assignment and be graded on the following nine tasks.

For each of the nine tasks, provide a screenshot and upload the JPEG (.jpg) file for your peers to review when you submit your work.

**Task 1:** Deploy a simple v1 guestbook application. (**2 points**)

**Task 2:** Use an in-memory data store for the simple guestbook application. (**1 point**)

**Task 3:** Update the simple guestbook homepage to include your name. (**1 point**)

**Task 4:** Automatically deploy the homepage update using a second image stream tag. (**1 point**)

**Task 5:** Deploy the second version of the guestbook application using an OpenShift build. (**5 points**)

**Task 6:** Deploy a Redis master, a Redis slave, and an analyzer microservice.(**3 points**)

**Task 7:** Use Redis for the v2 guestbook application instead of an in-memory datastore. (**1 point**)

**Task 8:** Submit entries to the guestbook and have their tone analyzed. Some simple sentences will not have a tone detected. Ensure that you submit something complex enough so that its tone is detected.(**2 points**)

**Task 9:** Create a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler that shows guestbook as the scale target, the current and desired replicas as three, and the last scale time as the time the deployment was scaled up to three replicas (**4 points**)

## Next Steps

Be sure to take screenshots as per review criteria as you follow the step-by-step instructions.
